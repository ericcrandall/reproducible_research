# Introducing the Shell

## Background
 
At a high level, computers do four things:

::: {.incremental}
- run programs
- store data
- communicate with each other, and
- interact with us
:::

##  {.smaller}

They can do the last of these in many different ways,
including direct brain-computer interfaces and speech recognition, using systems such as Alexa or Google Home.
While such hardware interfaces are becoming more commonplace, most interaction is still
done using screens, mice, touchpads and keyboards.


Although most modern desktop operating systems communicate with their human users by
means of windows, icons and pointers, these software technologies didn't become
widespread until the 1980s. The roots of such *graphical user interfaces* go back
to Doug Engelbart's work in the 1960s, which you can see in what has been
called "[The Mother of All Demos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11JDLBXtPQ)".



## The Command-Line Interface {.smaller}

Going back even further,
the only way to interact with early computers was to rewire them.
But in between,
from the 1950s to the 1980s,
most people used line printers.
These devices only allowed input and output of the letters, numbers, and punctuation found on a standard keyboard,
so programming languages and software interfaces had to be designed around that constraint.

This kind of interface is called a
**command-line interface**, or CLI,
to distinguish it from a
**graphical user interface**, or GUI,
which most people now use.

The heart of a CLI is a **read-evaluate-print loop**, or REPL:
when the user types a command and then presses the Enter (or Return; for Carriage Return) key,
the computer reads it,
executes it,
and prints its output.
The user then types another command,
and so on until the user logs off.

## The Shell {.smaller}

This description makes it sound as though the user sends commands directly to the computer,
and the computer sends output directly to the user.
In fact,
there is usually a program in between called a
**command shell**.
What the user types goes into the shell,
which then figures out what commands to run and orders the computer to execute them.
(Note that the shell is called "the shell" because it encloses the operating system
in order to hide some of its complexity and make it simpler to interact with.)

## Bash {.smaller}

A shell is a program like any other.
What's special about it is that its job is to run other programs
rather than to do calculations itself.
The most popular Unix/Linux shell is Bash,
the Bourne Again SHell
(so-called because it's derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne).
Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix
and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows.

## A Brief History of Unix {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}

- Developed at AT&T Bell Labs by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie in the mid-60’s 
- Became popular in academia in the 70’s and 80’s 
- Was heavily commercialized in the 80’s 
- As a reaction, Richard Stallman developed GNU (Gnu’s not Unix) 
- Linus Torvalds also developed an open-source version - Linux 
- Mac OSX is built entirely on top of a unix system (so commercialized again)
  - they recently replaced bash with zsh {shrug}

:::

## Characterized by:

- hierarchical file system
- use of plain text for storing data and commands
- large number of simple programs that can be strung together

-  >“the power of a system comes from the relationships among programs rather than the programs themselves” Kernigan and Pike 1984 

## Heirarchical File System

![Example File System](images/file_system.png)

## Paths: Absolute vs. Relative

- Absolute Path
  - specifies the location of a file or directory from the root directory(/)
  - “208 Mueller Lab, University Park, PA 16802”
  - /Users/edc5240

 - Relative Path
  - path related to the present working directory(pwd).
  - “Take a left on Atherton, take it through downtown State College and past the bus station, right on Curtin, keep left, just past the library, take a right into the parking circle, you'll see a loading dock. Park there. 
  - ../../usr/lib


## Using Bash {.smaller}

Using Bash or any other shell sometimes *feels* more like programming than like using a mouse:

 - Commands are terse (often only a couple of characters long),
 - their names are frequently cryptic
 - syntax is not simple or even consistent (but neither is English...)
 - their output is lines of text rather than something visual like a graph.
 - with great power comes great responsibility

 However, Bash is more akin to using an operating system like Windows or MacOS than using a computer language. 



## On the other hand... {.smaller}

... with only a few keystrokes, the Bash shell acts as:

-  Glue: combine existing tools into powerful pipelines
  - through scripts or pipelines 
  - Powerful and transformative

- Automator: handle large volumes of data automatically, thereby making our work
  - You generally can’t automate actions in Windows or MacOS (of course there are recordable macros but they are unwieldy).
  - With a shell, once you figure out how to do something, you can set it up and let it run over and over again

- Archive: Records the commands you type so you can inspect and repeat them later. 
  - much more reproducible
  - an electronic lab notebook

- Communicator: easily interact with remote servers




## It is worth your time to learn it! {.smaller}

As we move more and more into cloud computing for scientific analysis of "big data", we are actually moving away from GUI and back toward CLI!

# Environments and Environmental Variables

## $PATH

For something like PATH where you really do not want to overwrite what values are already stored, you can append values with
export PATH=$PATH:/new/dir/path/

In lists of values, the colon (:) is used as the delimiter. The dollar sign ($) is used to reference variables, so that export command essentially appends the new directory to the list of existing directories searched for executables. It is possible to prepend as well, which may come in handy if you compile a different version of an existing command.

## $HOME

## /bashrc and bash_profile


## docker and conda environments
